# The relaX library

> _"A collection of usefulness.."_

## What is this

The relaX library is a collection of useful functions, objects, and utilities for any python programmer. It is meant to **provide intuitive and easy-to-use functionality for all purposes**. Need a configuration file system that'll set itself up?

```python
import relaX.fig
```

is as easy as that.

RelaX was made so you could relax, instead of scratching your head.

### Why you should relax...

**NOTICE: This project is currently still in pre-alpha. Any contributions would be greatly appreciated. You can learn more about how to contribute [here](#contributing).**

You should be reassured that this program should work on _most_ computers. This is compatible with:

> - CPython versions **3.5 to 3.10**
> - PyPy3 compatible
> - MacOS python3.7 for _Xcode versions_ **9.4** _to_ **11**, python3.8 for _Xcode version_ **12**
> - Ubuntu versions tested for support: **_14.04_**, **_16.04_**, and **_18.04_**

## Contributing

### Code style: black

We don't need to chatter about the code style: use black and try to **keep it 90 or under characters per line**. Keep that in mind (maybe we should add a setup.cfg file).

I, Bryan, feel that everyone should be able to use technology and code, not needing to worry about anything else. **We ❤️ open-source**
