# The relaX library

> _"A collection of usefulness.."_

## What is this

The relaX library is a collection of useful functions, objects, and utilities for any python programmer. It is meant to **provide intuitive and easy-to-use functionality for all purposes**. Need a configuration file system that'll set itself up?

```python
import relaX.fig
```

is as easy as that.

RelaX was made so you could relax, instead of scratching your head.

## Getting started

Hooked? Here's some tips to get you started.

### Installation

Currently, this package is not available on the Python Package Index (PyPi).

But there are otheer installation options available.

#### via `git clone`

You can clone this repository, run `cd relaX`, and then run `pip install .` (or `python3 -m pip install .`).

Here's the complete installation script:

TODO: verify that the installation script is correct

```bash
/usr/bin/git clone https://github.com/ThatXliner/relaX.git
cd relaX
/usr/bin/pip3 install .
/usr/bin/python3 -m pip install .
```

or, a one-liner installation script:

```bash
/usr/bin/git clone https://github.com/ThatXliner/relaX.git && cd relaX && /usr/bin/pip3 install . ; /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install .
```

## via `pip install relaX`

Currently, this package is not available on the Python Package Index (PyPi).

### Usage

#### relaX.fig

#### relaX.time

## Contributing

### Code style: black

We don't need to chatter about the code style: use black and try to **keep it 90 or under characters per line**. Keep that in mind (maybe we should add a setup.cfg file).

## License (MIT)

MIT license.

I, Bryan, feel that everyone should be able to use technology and code, not needing to worry about anything else. **We ❤️ open-source**
